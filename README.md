Transfer Automations from a solution in one environment to a solution in another environment.
This tool will transfer Business Rules, Modern Flows, Actions, Classic Workflows and Business Process Flows. 
All Automations will be set to inactive after transfer. 
Modern Flows will be transfered without the Connection References. If a Modern Flow includes an Environmental Variable, the tool will check for the Variable in the new solution and create it if it doesn't exist.
